                Greening is the process of transforming living environments, and also artifacts such as a space, a lifestyle or a brand image, 
                into a more environmentally friendly version (i.e. 'greening your home' or 'greening your office'). 
                The act of greening generally involves incorporating more environmentally friendly systems into one's environment, such as the home, work place, and general lifestyle.
                Facade greening with various supporting climbing plants on climbing aids Greening is also a general term for the appropriate selection and planting of plants on, in, or next to buildings and in public parks. 
                The goal of greening is usually a combination of environmental benefits and improving the visual design of surfaces, for example, a green wall or green roof, as well as the creation of green spaces. 
                This usually requires technical measures such as earthworks or supporting climbing plants. Furthermore, permanent care and irrigation is usually necessary to maintain the greened environment. 
                In some areas there are normative requirements for the planning and execution of the greening, for example roadsides greening. In soil bioengineering, plants with technical functions may be needed.
                Measures such as the recultivation of heaps, plantations as part of a compensatory measure or, in tiller forestry, the planting of vegetation are distinguished from greening. 
                In professional parlance, the sowing or planting of agricultural crops is also referred to as crop growing or occasionally as field cultivation. 
                The term sowing is used for lawns.

                Children have been a particular focus in this area of research due to the increasingly limited access to green spaces and nature.
                 In urban areas, parents or guardians may favor playing indoors versus outdoors based on the perception of safety and concerns.
                 For example, families who live farther away from green spaces are more likely to push for indoor activities because of close proximity to busy roads or construction sites. 
                 On average, children in the United States spend about 1,000 hours a year in school.
                 Therefore, schools are an excellent tool for greening initiatives that involve children in urban spaces.

                The Florida Riffin Ridley School garden (Brookline, MA).
                Habitat restoration, gardening, naturalization and rewilding efforts in schools provide children with the opportunity to connect with nature. 
                In a study conducted in Finland, researchers found that adding green to the school yard increased passion for outdoor activity as well as creativity and spontaneity in 3 to 5 year old children.
                In Barcelona, Spain, school greening initiatives provided more opportunities for children to spend time outside and reduced inequities in residential access.
                In current efforts to limit exposure to COVID-19 and contact between individuals, school yards have become an even more important tool to promote social learning and education.
                Benefits of greening initiatives include electricity cost savings due to cooling technology of greening, improving the environment, providing healthy educational space, and more learning opportunities.

                Desert greening is more or less a function of water availability. If sufficient water for irrigation is at hand, any hot, cold,[citation needed] sandy or rocky desert can be greened. 
                Water can be made available through saving, reuse, rainwater harvesting, desalination, or direct use of seawater for salt-loving plants. 
                These different paths have unique features, i.e.: conserving water is a cheap solution. 
                Reuse of treated water and the closing of cycles is the most efficient because closed cycles stand for unlimited and sustainable supply - 
                rainwater management is a decentralized solution and applicable for inland areas - 
                desalination is very secure as long as the primary energy for the operation of the desalination plant is available - 
                Direct use of seawater for seawater agriculture is the most potent, only limited by the need for pumping up the water from sea level.
                A novel type of desalination is done with the Sahara Forest Project. This project uses solar stills for the generation of the freshwater. 
                Another novel technique is cloud seeding, either by artificial means or through the action of cloud-seeding bacteria that live on vegetation.
