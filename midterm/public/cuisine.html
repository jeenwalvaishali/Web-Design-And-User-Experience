                 <p class="article_card__text">Italy is by far one of the countries with the best food. 
                   Their straightforward approach to cooking, using simple ingredients such as olive oil, garlic, and pasta, 
                   gives them their spot on the list. But it’s not just pasta; they take comfort food to the next level with many different dishes.
                  On the top of the list is pizza, obviously. Their coffee has become a culture all its own, and, 
                  with their mix of easy-to-make and high-flavour dishes, it’s no wonder that everyone loves a good Italian meal. 
                  It is often voted as one of the best cuisines in the world. Yes you are correct! When it comes to Italy, 
                  the first thing that comes to mind is pizza, pasta and ice cream.
                  It is one of the first places that comes to mind when it comes to food, which,
                  of course, offers a unique flavor like pizza to the world, 
                  which is the homeland of pasta and adds flavor to our lives its unique ice cream.</p>

                 <p class="article_second_card__text">India is known for its abundant spice use. 
                   The dishes rely heavily on their high-flavour profiles instead of the meat or vegetables used in each particular item. 
                   With 38% of the country vegetarian, it is a good choice for those who eat plant-based diets.
                   With a large population of Indians around the world, 
                   they have helped spread the love for their food making it one of the best cuisines in the world.<br>
                  One of the best dishes to eat while travelling through India is Dal, a meal made with boiled lentils. 
                  A lentil dish might seem like a true yawn, but not a flavourful Dal. Other great choices include Dosa,
                  a pancake filled with literally anything the heart desires, washed down with a spiced Chai tea.<br>
                  With 8,000 years of history, Indian cuisine is perhaps one of the world’s most popular cuisines. Plenty of spicy dishes, 
                  vegetables are predominant and reflect the vegetarian culture.
                  Because the people of the country are considered holy, no meat is consumed anywhere in India except in a few regions. 
                   Kerala and Nort East are the regions that have consumed beef in the country.

                 <p class="article_third_card__text">The USA is a culture pot of cuisine, 
                   making it an excellent spot for travellers to test the waters with various flavours. 
                   Some of the most popular foods in the country originate from somewhere else, such as pizza, fries, and hamburgers. 
                   These global staples easily make the US one of the countries with the best cuisine.<br>
                   While their most famous foods may be copycats from other lands, they have some awe-inspiring homegrown 
                   dishes that are sure to wow anyone with a healthy appetite.<br>
                   Take the Rueben or Philly cheesesteak sandwiches, for example. 
                   The true deliciousness of these handhelds may be overlooked for their simplicity 
                   but are a must-try for anyone visiting the country. The classic chocolate chip cookie, 
                   also a homegrown American staple, changed the cookie game in a big way.</p>

                 <p class="article_second_card__text">Chinese food outside of China is nothing like the authentic versions found in its home country. 
                   Although the cuisine is ever-popular worldwide, the brave and adventurous “eat-anything” attitude of the 
                   cuisine gives the rest of the world the courage to try new and exciting things. 
                   Just the sheer volume of options makes it a regular choice as the best cuisine in the world.<br>
                   The very best dishes that can be found in the country include sweet and sour pork, 
                   a simple yet classic choice. Dim Sum, Roast suckling pig and Peking Duck are considered high class,
                   and Xiaolongbao, a surprise in a bowl, is also yummy. When thinking of the Chinese cuisine, you may think only rice and noodles. 
                   But in addition to rice and noodles, the country is famous for all kinds of meat dishes.<br>
                   Pork, beef, mutton, chicken, duck, pigeon and many other kinds of meat are the main hero in the delicious food of Chinese cuisine. 
                   It is unfair to mention only meat, rice and noodles when it comes to Chinese food.

                 <p class="article_third_card__text">The food scene in Mexico is no game. 
                   The country is full of dishes that many people wouldn’t be able to recognise if they compared them to the “Mexican” meals 
                   they’ve had in their home country.<br>Not only do they have stomach-filling comfort foods, 
                   but they also throw nutrition into the mix with the likes of avocado, tomato, lime, bean, chocolate, and chilis. 
                   Their antioxidant-rich approach to food is what keeps tourists coming back again and again. 
                   That’s why it is one of my favourites and I plan to go there myself to see why it is one of the countries with the best food.<br>
                   Among the dishes that stand out the most in Mexico include the chilaquiles, tacos al pastor, and mole. Chilaquiles, 
                   a popular breakfast dish, is a delightful mash-up of tortilla chips, eggs, salsa, and pulled chicken. <br>
                   Mole, the country’s unofficial sauce, comprises roughly 20 different ingredients pulling together to offer a 
                   flavour profile unlike any other. The tacos al pastor, a classic staple of split-roast pork, is simple to 
                   put together but complex in taste.</p>
